# Operating in the Shadows

The Pakistani I.T. and Crypto community is currently thriving while handcuffed. Despite the emergence of new regulatory frameworks like PVARA, the 'last mile' of banking remains a primary failure point.

## The Remittance Wall
Standard banks block inward remittances from global tech platforms, demanding excessive documentation for every dollar earned.

## The Inefficiency Tax
Traditional remittances carry hidden costs and delays, reducing effective earnings by up to 7% compared to the sub-2% potential of digital assets.

## The Identity Crisis
Operating via P2P or Hundi means builders are 'Wealthy on the Screen, but Poor on Paper.' You cannot show a bank statement to get a visa or a car loan because your wealth is undocumented.
