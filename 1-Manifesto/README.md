# 📖 1. The Manifesto: A New Jurisdiction

The world has split in two. There is the **Old World**—defined by borders, 29% corporate taxes, and paper bureaucracy. And there is the **Cloud Economy**—defined by code, remote work, and digital speed.

For too long, the 40 million tech workers of Pakistan have been "regulatory ghosts"—earning in the Cloud but suffering in the Old World.

### The Vision
Pixel Park is the world’s first **On-Chain Special Technology Zone**. We are not building a co-working space; we are building a **Sovereign Digital City** on physical soil.

### The Pakistan Advantage
We are bridging the gap between the speed of the digital economy and the stability of sovereign real estate.
* **Talent Arbitrage:** High-end tech skill at a fraction of global costs.
* **Sovereign Protection:** 10-year income tax holidays for all Citizens.
* **Infrastructure:** 262,120 sqft of Grade-A territory in Faisalabad.
