# The STZA Regulatory Umbrella

Pixel Park is a designated Special Technology Zone (STZ), authorized by the STZA. This status allows us to provide legislative 'shields' that are otherwise inaccessible to individual SMEs:

## Tax-Free Growth
0% Income and Turnover Tax for licensed Zone Enterprises for 10 years.

## Operational Freedom
The legal right to hold USD and pay global vendors (e.g., AWS) through SBP-mandated foreign currency accounts.

## Asset Liquidity
The ability to fractionalize and trade commercial inventory as digital assets ($SIKKA) under a sanctioned regulatory regime.
