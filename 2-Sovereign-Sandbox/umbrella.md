# 🛡️ The STZA Regulatory Umbrella

Pixel Park is not a private experiment; it is a state-sanctioned **Digital Economic Zone (DEZ)** operating under the **Special Technology Zones Authority (STZA) Act 2020**.

### Institutional Protections (10-Year Shield)
By minting a **Pixel Desk**, your entity is sheltered under a 10-year legislative umbrella:
1. **Income Tax Holiday:** 0% tax on all tech-enabled export and local revenue.
2. **Turnover Tax Exemption:** Complete removal of standard local levies.
3. **Forex Retention:** The legal right to hold 100% of your USD earnings in **Special Foreign Currency Accounts (SFCAs)**.
4. **Dividend Exemption:** Repatriate profits to global stakeholders without a secondary tax bite.

**This is not a 'tax hack'—it is a sovereign guarantee for the architects of the new economy.**
