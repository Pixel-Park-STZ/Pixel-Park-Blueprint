# ⚖️ 2. The Sovereign Sandbox

The Sovereign Sandbox is a collaborative regulatory environment between **The City**, the **Ministry of IT**, and the **STZA**. It is the "Policy Layer" of Pixel Park.

## 2.1 Sovereignty-as-a-Service
We have productized the bureaucracy of the Old World. By minting a **Pixel Desk**, a founder acquires more than space—they acquire a **Regulatory Shield**.

* **Automated Compliance:** Our smart contracts enforce STZA regulations (e.g., export-proceeds tracking) automatically.
* **10-Year Tax Holiday:** Verified Zone Enterprises are legally exempt from corporate income and turnover taxes until 2034.

## 2.2 The Smart Desk Identity (ERC-6551)
We utilize the **ERC-6551** standard to transform the Desk NFT into a **Token Bound Account (TBA)**.
* **Programmable P&L:** Since the company operates in $SIKKA, its profit and loss history is verifiable on-chain.
* **Instant M&A:** Selling a company in Pixel Park is as simple as transferring the Desk NFT. The new owner inherits the lease, the license, and the transaction history.

## 2.3 Dispute Resolution
In the event of a commercial dispute, the City employs a **Hybrid Arbitration Model**:
1. **On-Chain Escrow:** Smart contracts hold $SIKKA in escrow during service disputes.
2. **The High Council:** A panel of legal experts and community leaders acts as the "Digital Court" to resolve high-ticket conflicts.
