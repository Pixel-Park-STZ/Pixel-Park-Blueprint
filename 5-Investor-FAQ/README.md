# ❓ 5. Investor FAQ

We have compiled the most critical questions regarding the financial, legal, and operational structure of Pixel Park.

### 5.1 Is this legal under Pakistani law?
**Yes.** Pixel Park operates under the **Special Technology Zones Authority (STZA) Act of 2020**. We are a licensed Zone Developer. Our dual-entity structure (Offshore Treasury + Onshore Asset Co) ensures that we comply with both State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) and SECP regulations regarding foreign investment and digital assets.

### 5.2 What exactly am I buying when I buy $SIKKA?
You are buying **Fractionalized Real Estate Inventory**. Legally, $SIKKA represents an "Entitlement Right" to the economic benefits (Rent + Capital Appreciation) of a specific square foot of sanctioned commercial inventory within our portfolio.

### 5.3 How do I receive my rental yield?
Rent is collected from physical tenants in PKR. 
* **Distribution:** Yields are paid out monthly.
* **Method:** Direct IBFT (Bank Transfer) to your registered Pakistani bank account.
* **Tax:** Pixel Park acts as a withholding agent. We deduct 15% WHT for Filers and 30% for Non-Filers, issuing you a tax certificate automatically.

### 5.4 How does the 48-Hour Buy-Back work?
We solve real estate illiquidity through a **Liquidity Reserve**. 
* **The Reserve:** 50% of all capital raised from $SIKKA sales is held in liquid High-Yield T-Bills and Savings. 
* **The Exit:** When you request an "Expedited Buy-Back," the Treasury uses these liquid funds to purchase your tokens at the current NAV (Net Asset Value) minus a service fee. This ensures you are never "stuck" in a property.

### 5.5 Can I buy $SIKKA if I don't live in Pakistan?
**Yes.** The Pakistani Diaspora and International Investors can purchase $SIKKA using USD/USDT through our **Pixel Global (UAE)** entity. These funds enter Pakistan as white-listed Foreign Direct Investment (FDI), and your yields can be repatriated according to STZA guidelines.

### 5.6 What is a "Zombie Token"?
To prevent money laundering and fraud, our assets are KYC-gated.
* If you sell your NFT or $SIKKA on a secondary market to an unverified wallet, the asset enters **"Zombie State."**
* In this state, the token does NOT earn rent and cannot be used for physical access. 
* Utility is only restored once the new owner completes KYC on our dashboard.
