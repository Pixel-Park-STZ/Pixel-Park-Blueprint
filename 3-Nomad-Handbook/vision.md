# Identity & The Digital Rebellion

The Pixel Nomad pays direct homage to the lineage of the CryptoPunks. Launched in 2017, they started a revolution by proving that a digital image could represent verifiable ownership.

## Homage to the OGs
We acknowledge this heritage in our name—Pixel Park.

## Desi-Cyberpunk Aesthetic
These PFPs feature high-end 3D character designs that fuse Pakistani heritage with industrial futurism—think tactical cyber-vests over Shalwar Kameez and Ajrak patterns on VR headsets.
