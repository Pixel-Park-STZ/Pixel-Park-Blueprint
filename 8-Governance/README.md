# 🗳️ 8. Governance & The Council

Pixel Park is a meritocratic jurisdiction. Governance power is distributed across three tiers of citizens.

### 8.1 The High Council (Founders)
Holders of the **Pixel Desk** NFTs have the highest voting weight. They decide on major infrastructure upgrades and secondary market fee structures.

### 8.2 The Node Operators (Strategic Partners)
Our Node Operators act as the "Senators" of the city. They bridge their communities into the zone and provide the social validation required for growth.

### 8.3 The Citizen Assembly (Nomads)
Pixel Nomads have voting rights over the "Sandbox Treasury"—a pool of funds dedicated to community events, guest speakers, and local amenities within the park.
