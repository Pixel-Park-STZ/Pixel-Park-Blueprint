# 💰 4. The Economic Engine ($SIKKA)

**$SIKKA** is the ecosystem's native Enable Coin, 100% collateralized by high-yield commercial real estate.

## 4.1 Asset-Backed Minting
We operate on the **"Concrete Standard."**
* **Supply Logic:** 1 $SIKKA = 1 Square Foot of sanctioned inventory.
* **Hard Cap:** Total supply is mathematically tethered to the **Government-Approved Building Plans** of our portfolio. We cannot "print" tokens; we only tokenize concrete.

## 4.2 The 50/50 Liquidity Protocol
To guarantee our **48-Hour Buy-Back**, we employ a strict capital preservation strategy:
1. **50% of Raise:** Goes into physical construction (Appreciating Asset).
2. **50% of Raise:** Held in a **Liquidity Reserve** (T-Bills/Savings) to fund exits.

## 4.3 The Circular Economy
$SIKKA is the transactional currency of the Park. All internal services (Legal fees, Coffee, Meeting Rooms) receive a **20% Discount** when settled in $SIKKA.
