# 6. Asset Profile: $SIKKA

$SIKKA is the world's first "Enable Coin"—a digital inventory right 100% collateralized by high-yield commercial real estate in the Gatwala Commercial Hub.

## The 20/30/50 Allocation Model

*   **20% - Global Liquidity Pool**: Seeding the $SIKKA/USDC pair for instant off-ramping.
*   **30% - Development Fund**: Invested into physical "Concrete Growth" of the project.
*   **50% - Sovereign Reserve**: Held in High-Yield T-Bills to fund the Buy-Back Loop.

## 🛡️ The Buy-Back Baseline

### The Rule
If you sell a token back to the Treasury, the refund is calculated based on your Original Baseline (50k for Nomads, 100k for Public).

### Stability Lock
No Treasury Buy-Backs are processed for the first 90 days.
