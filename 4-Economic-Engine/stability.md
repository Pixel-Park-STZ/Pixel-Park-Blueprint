# The Buy-Back Baseline (Identity of Value)

We offer a Principal Protection Guarantee. To remain 100% solvent, the Platform only returns what it has actually received. Every $SIKKA token carries a 'Buy-Back Baseline' in its metadata.

| Token Tier | Acquisition Source | Buy-Back Baseline |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Genesis Tier | Purchased during Nomad Sprint | PKR 50,000 |
| Public Tier | Purchased from Platform Store | PKR 100,000 |

## The Rule
If you sell back to the Treasury, the refund is calculated based on this original baseline, regardless of the current market price or what you paid a third party on the P2P marketplace.
