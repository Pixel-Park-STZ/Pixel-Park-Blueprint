# 🚀 Welcome to Pixel Park STZ

**Invest in Concrete. Operate in the Cloud.**

Pixel Park is Pakistan’s first blockchain-enabled **Special Technology Zone (STZ)**. We are digitizing 262,120 sqft of physical sovereign infrastructure to build the first on-chain digital jurisdiction for the global tech economy.

### 🏙️ What is the City?
We are bridging the gap between the speed of the digital economy and the stability of real-world assets. Our ecosystem transforms office space into **Programmable Corporate Identities** and real estate into **Liquid Inventory**.

### 🛠️ Core Pillars
* **Sovereignty:** 10-year government-backed tax holidays.
* **Identity:** ERC-6551 Token Bound Accounts (Desks = Companies).
* **Liquidity:** $SIKKA-powered 48-hour real estate exit loop.
