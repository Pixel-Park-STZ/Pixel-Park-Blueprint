# 🛠️ 6. Technical Specifications

Pixel Park is built on the philosophy of **"Invisible Web3."** We remove the complexity of blockchain so our citizens can focus on building.

## 6.1 Invisible Onboarding (Account Abstraction)
We utilize **ERC-4337 (Account Abstraction)** to provide a Web2-style experience.
* **Social Login:** Citizens join via Email or WhatsApp OTP.
* **Gasless Transactions:** The City Treasury sponsors gas fees via a **Paymaster**, ensuring users pay $0 for basic ecosystem interactions.

## 6.2 The Smart Contract Suite
* **Pixel Nomad (ERC-1155):** A semi-fungible passport that stores "Redemption Units" and "Seed Allocations."
* **Pixel Desk (ERC-721 + ERC-6551):** A non-fungible corporate identity that acts as an autonomous wallet.
* **$SIKKA (ERC-20):** Our native Enable Coin, pegged to real-world Net Asset Value (NAV).

## 6.3 Real-World Oracles
We utilize **Managed Price Oracles** to peg the value of $SIKKA to the physical Gatwala Commercial Hub. Independent 3rd-party property valuations are pushed on-chain quarterly to ensure the "Concrete Standard" is maintained.
