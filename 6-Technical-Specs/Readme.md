# Technical Infrastructure: Invisible Web3

We have removed the 'Complexity Barrier' through a specialized tech stack.

## 7.1 Invisible Bridge (Account Abstraction)
We utilize ERC-4337 standard to transform the complex 'Crypto Wallet' into a user-friendly Sovereign Vault. Users sign up using Email, Google, or WhatsApp OTP.

## 7.2 Gasless City
We operate a Paymaster Protocol. The Platform Treasury sponsors gas fees. On-chain interactions cost the user Zero.

## 7.4 Security & Recovery
Private keys are split into multiple shards (MPC). If a user loses access, they can recover their vault via verified social credentials.
