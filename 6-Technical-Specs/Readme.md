# 7. Technical Infrastructure

## 7.1 The Invisible Bridge (Account Abstraction)
We utilize ERC-4337 to transform the complex "Crypto Wallet" into a user-friendly Sovereign Vault.

## 7.4 Security & The Zombie Protocol
By tying every wallet to a NADRA-verified KYC, we provide an institutional layer of security. If a token is transferred externally without using our dashboard, it enters "Zombie State" and yields are paused until re-verification.
